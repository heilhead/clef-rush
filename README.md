# Clef Rush

Piano learning app that helps train music sheet reading skills and keyboard layout.

Available online at https://heilhead.github.io/clef-rush/.

## Hardware Requirements

While the app doesn't require a hardware keyboard, it's best to train with one connected via MIDI interface. Alternatively, the on-screen virtual keyboard can be used (NOTE: only mouse clicking is currently supported, not compatible with touch screen).

## Compatibility

Some browsers are currently buggy when working with MIDI devices, and if you encounter problems with connecting your keyboard, you may need to restart your browser, OS or switch to a different browser. Google Chrome seems to be the most compatible and least buggy.
